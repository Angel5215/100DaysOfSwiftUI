# Day 01. Simple types

- Variables are created using `var` and constants using `let`. It's preferable to use constants as often as possible.

- Strings start and end with double quotes (e.g `"This is a string"`).

- Multiline strings are used when you want a string to run across multiple lines. These are created using three sets of double quotes.

- Integers hold whole numebrs, doubles hold fractional numebrs and booleans hold `true` or `false`.

- String interpolatioin allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside a string.

- Swift uses **type inference** to assign each variable or constant a type. It is also possible to provide **explicit types** when necessary.
