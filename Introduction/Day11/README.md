# Day 11. Protocols and extensions

- **Protocols** describe what methods and properties a conforming type must have, but do not provide the implementations of those methods.

- You can build protocols on top of other protocols, similar to classes. This is called protocol inheritance.

- **Extensions** let you add methods and computed properties to specific types.

- Protocol extensions let you add methods and computed properties to protocols.

- **Protocol-oriented programming** (POP) is the practice of designing your app architecture as a series of protocols, then using protocol extensions to provide default implementations.
