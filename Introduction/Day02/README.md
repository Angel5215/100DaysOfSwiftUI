# Day 02. Complex types

- Arrays, sets, tuples and dictionaries are called **collections** because they let you store a group of items under a single value.

- **Arrays** store items in the **order you add them**. Arrays are accessed using numerical positions.

- **Sets** store items **without any order**. Sets can't contain duplicate elements and are searching a value in a set is faster than searching in an array.

- **Tuples** are fixed in size and you can attach names to each of the items. It's possible to read items using numerical positions or using the names you specified.

- **Dictionaries** store items **according to a key**, you read those items using that key.

- **Enums** are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without any chance of spelling mistakes. 

- Enums let you add an associated value to its cases to provide additional information so that they can represent more meaningful data.

- Enum also let you attach **raw values** so that they can be created from integers or strings.
