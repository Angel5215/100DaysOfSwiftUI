# Day 03. Operators and conditions

- Swift has operators for doing arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, ...) and for comparison (`<`, `>`, `<=` `>=`, ...).

- There are compound variants of arithmetic operators that modify their variables in place (`+=`, `-=`, ...).

- Use `if`, `else` and `else if` to run code based on the result of a condition.

- The ternary operator `:?` combines a ceck with true and false code blocks. 

- When you have multiple conditions using the same value, it's often clearer to use `switch` instead of `if-else` blocks.

- You can make ranges using `..<` (doesn't include last number) and `...` (includes last number).
