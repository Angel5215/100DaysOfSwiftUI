# iExpense

This project is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things youâ€™re going to need to learn how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
- Delete rows from a list
- Save and load user data
