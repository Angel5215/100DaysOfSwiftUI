# Navigation

This technique project takes a close look at navigation in SwiftUI – how we move from one screen to another using NavigationStack, both because the user asked for it and also because we want to do it automatically at a specific time.

It also covers more advanced navigation, including handling state restoration – remembering exactly where the user had navigated to, so when your app launches in the future they can pick up where they left off.

Finally, it looks at some customization options: changing the way the navigation bar looks, positioning your buttons just right, and even how to let your user change the navigation title on demand.
