# WordScramble

This project is another game that will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

The Swift and SwiftUI components that are shown in this project are `List`, `onAppear()`, `Bundle`, `fatalError()`, and more. This project also offers some more practice with `@State`, `NavigationStack`.
