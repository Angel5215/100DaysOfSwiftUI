# Moonshot

This project is an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program. You’ll get more experience with `Codable`, but more importantly you’ll also work with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts.

Yes, you’ll get some practice time with `List`, `Text`, and more, but you’ll also start to solve important SwiftUI problems – how can you make an image fit its space correctly? How can we clean up code using computed properties? How can we compose smaller views into larger ones to help keep our project organized?
