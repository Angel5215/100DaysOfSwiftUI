This SwiftUI project is another forms-based app that introduces one of the true power features of iOS development: machine learning (ML).

**CoreML** is an Apple framework which allows us to write code that makes predictions about new data based on previous data it has seen. The app is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good nightâ€™s sleep by asking them three questions:

1. When do they want to wake up?
2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
