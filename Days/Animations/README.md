# Animations

This is another technique project, and this time we’re going to be looking at something fast, beautiful, and really under-valued: animations.

In this technique project we’re going to look at a range of animations and transitions with SwiftUI. Some are easy – in fact, you’ll be able to get great results almost immediately! – but some require more thinking. All will be useful, though, particularly as you work to make sure your apps are attractive and help guide the user’s eyes as best as you can.
