# Challege project #1. Unit converter

This is the first challenge project in the 100 Days of SwiftUI. It consists in an app that can handle unit conversions. 

- Users can select an input unit and an output unit.
- Users can enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.
- The initial challenge is to handle a single type of the following units:
    - Temperature: users can choose Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
    - Length: users can choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards or miles.
    - Time: users can choose seconds, minutes, hours or days.
    - Volume: users can choose milliliters, liters, cups, pints or gallons.

- For a bigger challenge, the app adds a third segmented control that allows users to change the unit being converted.
