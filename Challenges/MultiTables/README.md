## Challenge description

This is the third challenge project in the 100 Days of SwiftUI. It consists in an app that helps practicing mutliplication tables.

- The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 1 to 12.

- The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.

- You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you should generate all possible combinations.
