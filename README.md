## Wrap-up Challenge. Day 99

1. Add a photo credit over the `ResortView` image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.

2. Fill in the loading and saving methods for `Favorites`.

3. For a real challenge, let the user sort and filter the resorts in `ContentView`. For sorting use default, alphabetical, and country, and for filtering let them select country, size, or price.
