## Wrap-up Challenge. Day 76

1. The check out view in [Cupcake Corner](CupcakeCorner) uses an image that doesn’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read it out.

2. Fix the steppers in [BetterRest](BetterRest) so that they read out useful information when the user adjusts their values.

3. Do a full accessibility review of [Moonshot](Moonshot) – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?

You can check the changes in code but it is recommended to test with a device with VoiceOver activated. Alternatively, you can launch the Accessibility Inspector to examine accessibility labels, values, traits and identifiers.
