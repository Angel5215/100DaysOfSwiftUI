## Wrap-up challenge - Day 38

1. Add an Edit/Done button to `ContentView` so users can delete rows more easily.

2. Modify the expense amounts in `ContentView` to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.

3. Add some validation to the Save button in `AddView`. If you enter “fish” or another thing that can’t be converted to an integer, show an alert telling users what the problem is.
