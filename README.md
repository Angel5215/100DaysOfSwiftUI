## Challenge days

The projects in this section are completely started from scratch and are designed to test what I learned over the last days. My attempt at solving them will be uploaded in the [Challenges](Challenges) folder.

- [Challenge 1](Challenges/Unit%20Converter). Unit conversion app.
- [Challenge 2](Challenges/Brain%20RPS). Brain training with rock, paper, scissors.

## Wrap-up challenges

The solution for challenges of wrap-up days will be uploaded in separate branches to keep the projects in a state that can be used for a later review or upcoming challenges that use the same projects. To check my attempts at solving them, just checkout the branch from the following list:

- Day 18: `challenge/project_one_day_18`
- Day 22: `challenge/project_two_day_22`.
- Day 24: `challenge/project_three_day_24`
