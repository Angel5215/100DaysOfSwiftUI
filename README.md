## Wrap-up challenges. Day 56

1. Right now it’s possible to select no genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing a default, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.

2. Modify `ContentView` so that books rated as 1 star have their name shown in red.

3. Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning `Date()` to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in `DetailView`.
