## Challenge days

The projects in this section are completely started from scratch and are designed to test what I learned over the last days. My attempt at solving them will be uploaded in the [Challenges](Challenges) folder.

## Wrap-up challenges

The solution for challenges of wrap-up days will be uploaded in separate branches to keep the projects in a state that can be used for a later review or upcoming challenges that use the same projects. To check my attempts at solving them, just checkout the branch from the following list:

- Day 18: `challenge/project_one_day_18`
