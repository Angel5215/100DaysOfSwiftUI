## Wrap-up challenge. Day 73

1. Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?

2. Having a complex `if` condition in the middle of `ContentView` isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the `MapView`, `Circle`, and `Button` are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!

3. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one `alert()` modifier to each view.
