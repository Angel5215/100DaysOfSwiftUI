# 100DaysOfSwiftUI (iOS 17 update)

Repository made to follow 100 Days of SwiftUI updated for iOS 17.

This repository originally contained progress for the original 100 Days of SwiftUI made with SwiftUI 1.0. This content was moved to the `legacy/swiftui-1.0` branch. The new goal of this branch is to keep track of the current 100 Days of SwiftUI which currently target iOS 17 as lots of changes were made in the 5-year span from when SwiftUI was originally released.
