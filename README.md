## Wrap-up Challenge - Day 46

1. Create an `Arrow` shape made from a rectangle and a triangle â€“ having it point straight up is fine.

2. Make the line thickness of your `Arrow` shape animatable.

3. Create a `ColorCyclingRectangle` shape that is the rectangular cousin of `ColorCyclingCircle`, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
