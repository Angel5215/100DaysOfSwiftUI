# Project 9. Drawing

This technique project takes a close look at drawing in SwiftUI, including creating custom paths and shapes, animating changes, solving performance problems and more.

## Topics

- `Path`

## Images

<p align="center"><img src="img/run-example.gif" height="600px"></p>

## Notes 

- **`Path`** is a dedicated type given to us by SwiftUI used for drawing custom shapes. It's very low level so you will usually want to wrap it in something else to make it more usefult but it is still the building block that underlies other work.
